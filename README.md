<h3>Description of Project</h3>
This project is a culmination of the aspects that we have learned to date including HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. It contains a 5 question, multiple-choice timed quiz. The user should have a 60 second timer for the quiz on random knowledge and the system should have the ability to locally store their score and initials.
  
The quiz also contains a penalty of -5 points per incorrect answer, with a second penalty of removing 10 seconds from the clock if they answer incorrectly.
  
The user can store multiple scores locally, and there is also a button to clear the scores at their leisure too.
